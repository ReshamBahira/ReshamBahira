## Hi there 👋

Hi there! 👋 I'm Resham Bahira

🎓 Currently pursuing a Master's in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University 🍊
🎓 Completed a Bachelor's in Statistics

I'm passionate about turning data into stories and models into magic! Whether it’s analyzing trends, building predictive models, or crafting powerful visualizations, I’m here to make data work its charm. 💡

When I’m not busy crunching numbers, you’ll find me exploring new ML techniques, experimenting with deep learning, or brainstorming how to make public health data fashionably impactful. ✨
